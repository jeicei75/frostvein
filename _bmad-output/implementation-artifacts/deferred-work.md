# Deferred Work

Items surfaced by review that were real but not actionable at the time. Each entry
names where it came from and what should trigger revisiting it.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-a-seeded-frozen-world-exists (2026-08-02)

- **A spawn that ignores the RNG draw is not detected by the test suite**
  (`crates/sim-core/src/lib.rs:166`). Replacing `rng.random_range(0..candidates.len())`
  with a constant index still passes all six tests, including the strengthened
  cross-seed dwarf-position assertion — because the candidate list is itself
  terrain-derived and therefore seed-dependent, so positions still differ between
  seeds. Left open deliberately: it violates no AC (AC7 requires distinct positions,
  valid tiles and allocator-issued ids; AC8/AC9 still hold) and contradicts only the
  task wording "positions chosen from the worldgen stream". Closing it requires
  asserting scan-order properties — either duplicating production candidate logic in
  the test or a brittle clustering heuristic — both worse than the gap under the
  project's simplicity policy. **Revisit if** spawn placement becomes
  gameplay-relevant (embark-site selection), which would give it a real AC to test
  against.

- **Single RNG stream couples dwarf positions to terrain's exact draw count**
  (`crates/sim-core/src/lib.rs:79-91`). One `ChaCha8Rng` is threaded sequentially
  through `height_field` → `layered_terrain` → `spawn_dwarves`. `layered_terrain`
  consumes exactly `dims.x * dims.y` bool draws before the spawn code reads a single
  value, so any later change to surface-material selection (a third material, a
  skipped draw for ramp columns) silently relocates all five dwarves and invalidates
  every recorded scenario baseline and save file — with no test failing to explain
  why. Story 1.1 mandated the single `STREAM_WORLDGEN` stream, so the code is
  compliant. AD-7's "purpose-named streams" is the relevant architectural decision.
  **Revisit at Story 2.4**, when `SaveState` must persist RNG stream state.

- **Spawn distribution is biased toward the map border**
  (`crates/sim-core/src/lib.rs:143-153`). `is_flat` filters out-of-bounds neighbours
  before `.all()`, so a corner column is judged on 2 neighbours while an interior
  column is judged on 4 — border columns are systematically likelier to qualify.
  Observed: seed 0 spawns a dwarf at `Pos { x: 0, y: 26, z: 20 }`, hard against the
  wall. No AC requires interior spawning, so this is an unintended distribution
  rather than a defect. **Revisit if** dwarf starting position becomes
  gameplay-relevant, or when a real embark-site rule replaces the placeholder.

- **Story artifacts reference planning docs that are untracked**
  (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-1-a-seeded-frozen-world-exists.md`
  References section). The story cites `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`,
  the architecture spine, the PRD, the implementation-readiness report, and
  `docs/architecture.md` — all currently untracked in git. This branch commits the
  artifact while leaving every dependency uncommitted, so a fresh clone gets a story
  whose evidence chain dangles. Pre-existing repo hygiene, not caused by this story.
  **Revisit when** Wolf decides what of `_bmad-output/` belongs in version control.
